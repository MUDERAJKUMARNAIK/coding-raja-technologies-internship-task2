# Indian Food Classification Using TensorFlow

This project focuses on classifying different types of Indian food using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in TensorFlow.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess image data for training and testing.
- **Model Building**: Build a CNN model using TensorFlow.
- **Training**: Train the model on the Indian food dataset.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance on test data.
- **Prediction**: Make predictions on new images.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/indian-food-classification.git
   cd indian-food-classification
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook indian-food-classification-using-tensorflow.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to load data, build, train, and evaluate the model.

## Dataset

Ensure you have the Indian food image dataset prepared and stored in an accessible directory. Update the dataset path in the notebook accordingly.
